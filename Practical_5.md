ðŸ§± Practical 5: Identifying Domain Classes from the Problem Statements
ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To identify domain classes and their attributes/methods from the problem statement using a class-based approach.
________________________________________
ðŸ“˜ Introduction
Domain classes define the object-oriented structure of the system. Identifying them early helps in transitioning to Class Diagrams and implementation.

ðŸ“š Theory
â€¢	ðŸ§¾ Noun Extraction Technique: Identify classes (nouns), attributes, and methods (verbs).
â€¢	ðŸŽ­ Class: A template for objects.
â€¢	ðŸ§© Components of a Class:
o	Name
o	Attributes
o	Operations/Methods

ðŸ§ª Case Study: Motor Transport Section
Identified Classes:
â€¢	Driver: name, licenseNo â†’ assignToTrip()
â€¢	Vehicle: vehicleNo, type â†’ assignToDriver()
â€¢	Trip: source, destination â†’ scheduleTrip()
â€¢	Request: date, purpose â†’ approveRequest()
Each class holds data and behavior relevant to the system.

âœ… Conclusion
Identifying domain classes builds the foundation for object-oriented design and helps in drawing Class and Sequence Diagrams later.
