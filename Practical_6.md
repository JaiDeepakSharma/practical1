🔄 Practical 6: Statechart and Activity Modeling
🎯 Aim
To understand and model the dynamic behavior of the Motor Transport System using UML Statechart Diagrams and Activity Diagrams.
________________________________________
📘 Introduction
Dynamic modeling deals with how the system changes over time or based on events. Statechart diagrams show state transitions, while Activity diagrams show workflows or the order of execution of operations.

📚 Theory
•	⚙️ Statechart Diagram:
o	Represents states (e.g., Requested, Approved, Assigned)
o	Shows transitions based on events
•	🧭 Activity Diagram:
o	Describes control flow between activities
o	Includes forks, joins, decisions, start/end nodes

🧪 Case Study: Motor Transport Section
📌 Statechart Example: Vehicle Request Flow
•	Initial State → Request Raised → Approved → Assigned → Trip Completed → Final State
📌 Activity Diagram Example:
•	Requester → Fill Request Form → Submit Request
•	Transport Officer → Approve Request → Assign Vehicle & Driver → Notify Driver
🖼️ Diagrams clearly show sequence and flow of responsibilities in request handling.

✅ Conclusion
State and activity diagrams help in analyzing system behavior, ensuring each component responds correctly to user and system actions.
