🔁 Practical 8: Modeling Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
🎯 Aim
To represent the data flow and process transformations in the Motor Transport System using DFD (Level 0 & Level 1).
________________________________________
📘 Introduction
DFDs visualize the movement of data between processes, data stores, and external entities. It helps in understanding how inputs are transformed into outputs.

📚 Theory
•	🔄 DFD Components:
o	External Entities (squares)
o	Processes (circles)
o	Data Stores (open rectangles)
o	Data Flows (arrows)
•	🧬 Levels:
o	Level 0 (Context Diagram): Single process with all entities
o	Level 1 (Expanded DFD): Breaks main process into subprocesses

🧪 Case Study: Motor Transport Section
📌 Level 0 DFD:
•	Entities: Requester, Driver, Admin
•	Process: Motor Transport System
•	Data Stores: Requests, Vehicles, Drivers
📌 Level 1 DFD:
•	Subprocesses: Request Handling, Vehicle Assignment, Maintenance Scheduling
•	Flow: Requester → [Submit Request] → [Validate] → [Assign Driver/Vehicle] → [Log Trip]
📊 Diagrams created using standard Gane & Sarson notation

✅ Conclusion
DFDs ensure clear visualization of system functionality and serve as blueprints for database and process design.
