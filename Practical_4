üöó Motor Transport System - SEPM Practical
üìå Aim
To model a UML Use Case Diagram and capture use case scenarios for a Motor Transport System that automates transport request handling, driver and vehicle assignment, fuel tracking, and maintenance scheduling within an organization.
________________________________________
üß† Introduction
In organizations with a dedicated transport department, managing transport logistics manually is inefficient and prone to error. The Motor Transport System simplifies this by:
‚Ä¢	Allowing employees to raise transport requests,
‚Ä¢	Enabling transport officers to assign vehicles and drivers,
‚Ä¢	Recording fuel usage, and
‚Ä¢	Scheduling vehicle maintenance.
This practical demonstrates software engineering principles like requirement gathering, system modeling, and documentation using UML diagrams.

üìö Theory
‚û§ Objectives
After completing this practical, you will be able to:
‚Ä¢	Understand user interactions within the Motor Transport System.
‚Ä¢	Develop a Use Case Diagram based on user roles and system functionality.
‚Ä¢	Write detailed Use Case Scenarios for each actor.
‚û§ Actors in the System
Actor	Role Description
Requester	Requests transport services.
Transport Officer	Approves requests, assigns drivers & vehicles.
Driver	Records fuel usage, executes assigned trips.
Admin	Manages system maintenance and service scheduling.
üìù Use Case Descriptions
1. Request Transport
Actor: Requester
Description: User fills a form to request a vehicle for a particular date and time.
2. Approve Request
Actor: Transport Officer
Description: Reviews and approves/rejects transport requests.
3. Assign Driver
Actor: Transport Officer
Description: Assigns an available driver to the approved transport request.
4. Assign Vehicle
Actor: Transport Officer
Description: Assigns an available and suitable vehicle.
5. Record Fuel Usage
Actor: Driver
Description: Logs fuel consumption for each trip taken.
6. Schedule Maintenance
Actor: Admin
Description: Schedules regular maintenance for all vehicles.
7. Generate Reports
Actor: Transport Officer
Description: Generates usage and maintenance reports for review.

üß™ Case Study
Let‚Äôs consider a real-world scenario:
‚Ä¢	Mr. Rahul (Requester) submits a request for a car on April 20 for a client meeting.
‚Ä¢	Ms. Priya (Transport Officer) approves the request, assigns Driver Arjun and Vehicle TN09AB1234.
‚Ä¢	Driver Arjun completes the trip, records fuel usage.
‚Ä¢	Admin Ravi schedules the vehicle for periodic maintenance.
‚Ä¢	Ms. Priya generates a monthly usage report.

‚úÖ Conclusion
By completing this practical, students understand how to:
‚Ä¢	Identify system requirements from real-world needs.
‚Ä¢	Model system interaction using UML Use Case Diagrams.
‚Ä¢	Clearly define and document actor interactions through use case scenarios.
This helps lay a strong foundation for software requirement analysis and design in larger software engineering projects.
